## Business modeling

### Elevator Pitch

As you know, browsing Sigarra to search for all the important dates and copying to your calendar gets old pretty quick... Wouldn't it be better if you had every important information just one click away? Well, you're in luck because Smart Calendar is here!
One click away of every information you need, elegant, customizable and easy to use, the Smart Calendar is the app you always needed but didn't know. With it, balancing your free time with the university classwork will be easier than ever by using the synchronize button to import all the important Sigarra events and your weekly schedule and later adding all your personal events.
On top of all of this we have another important feature... Ever forgot a class or where it was? Well, say goodbye to those days because with the notifications you will be always up to date with your appointments!

## Implementation

The main product increments can be found [here](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/3LEIC07T3/releases).

A more datailed description of the increments in our implementation can be seen in our commit history [here](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/3LEIC07T3/commits/main).

## Test

We have tested the following features:

Gherkin:

* Add Event
* Edit Event
* Google Maps
* Remove Event
* Sync with Sigarra
* View_Event

## Configuration and change management

Configuration and change management are key activities to control change to, and maintain the integrity of, a project’s artifacts (code, models, documents).

For the purpose of ES, we will use a very simple approach, just to manage feature requests, bug fixes, and improvements, using GitHub issues and following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

---

## Project management

In this project, to be able to properly manage our project we used Github Projects. 
That way we were able to register the tasks we had done, tasks we were doing and the tasks still to do. 
In addition, we were able to assign group members to each task, as well as being able to add effort estimations to each task.

Our board can be seen [here](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/3LEIC07T3/projects/1).

---

So far, contributions are exclusively made by the initial team, but we hope to open them to the community, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.

Please contact us! 

Thank you!
