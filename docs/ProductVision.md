# Product Vision
Your timetable and your personal agenda, all in one. Schedule or re-schedule events and check when, where and which classes you're having today. Worried about forgetting any of the above? Don't worry, we got you: set up pre-event notifications so you're always up to date with your tasks.

## Vision Statement
> Time it right or get timed.

For students who would like a simple and more intuitive version to schedule their time, the Smart Calendar is an application add-on that provides access to one's timetable, the possibility to add personal events and even the option to receive notifications. Unlike SIGARRA, our application allows you to add and manage your personal events.

The timetable (captured from SIGARRA) is split in classes, and each of the previous is introduced in the calendar as an editable and removable event, just like a self-added one. This way, when/if the scholar routine changes, the student is granted a fluid re-scheduling.

## Main Features
- Feature 1 - Monthly and daily view of the calendar
- Feature 2 - Add/Remove/Edit/Search events
- Feature 3 - SIGARRA's calendar syncronization and merging
- Feature 4 - Notifications of events (push notifications)
- Feature 5 - Custom settings (events, calendar or notification related)

## Required API's
- Read student's timetable from SIGARRA
- Read SIGARRA's scholar calendar
- Store added personal events
