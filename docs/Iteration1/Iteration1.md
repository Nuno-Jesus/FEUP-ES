## 2 - Questions/Answers

### What went well ?

- Implementation of the proposed iterations as expected, workflow of the group and git (including branches, commits well comment and pull requests) as good and very easy to communicate.

### What should we do differently ?

- Pull requests with approval from different teammates, have integration in Iteration 2 with the UniApp to have the automated tests to see if the work is well implemented and not stall the work until the Iteration deadline. 

### What still puzzles me ?

- Integration correctly of the database to save events on backend and have all every-time we open the app.
